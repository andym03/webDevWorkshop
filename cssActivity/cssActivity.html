<h1>Monospaced fonts</h1>

<p>
In a monospaced font, the letters all occupy the same amount of horizontal space. In variable-width fonts, the size of letters and spacings between them can be different.

You're editing this paragraph in a code editor with a monospace font, but styling it with a variable-width font! As well as making coding easier, monospace fonts are fun because you can create ASCII art with them. Style the following span with a monospace font and see what happens!
